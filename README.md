Golem
=====

GOLEM is a numerical simulator for modelling coupled Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical processes in faulted geothermal reservoirs.
The simulator is developed by Antoine Jacquey and Mauro Cacace at the [GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/home/).
GOLEM is a MOOSE-based application. Visit the [MOOSE framework](http://mooseframework.org) page for more information.
