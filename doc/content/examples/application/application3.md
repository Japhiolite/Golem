# Application 3

## Description

This example refers to the following publication: Watanabe, Bl√∂cher, Cacace Held and Kohl: Geoenergy Modeling 3, Enhanced Geothermal Systems, Springer Verlag, 2017.

In this example heat extraction from a hot, dry granite rock is simulated. The heat extraction is achieved by a fluid circulation in an artificial fracture in the granite layer. The target horizon is located in a depth of 4000 m with in situ temperatures of $200 \degree C$ thus resulting in an initial pore pressure of $10 \, MPa$ at the center of the domain. The fracture geometry is assumed to be square with an edge length of 300 m. To achieve a fluid circulation a doublet system with two wells in a distance of 150 m of each other and 75m to the edges of the fracture is installed. The production rate is set to $1 \, L/s$ and the injection temperature is set to $70 \degree C$ at which the water exists in a liquid phase due to the pressure.

The injection and production point are located at a certain depth so that they are in the middle of the domain regarding the z-axis. The permeability of the fracture is determined by the cubic law and the fluid viscosity is regarded as temperature dependent, given by the following equation:

$ \mu = 2.393 \times 10^{\frac{248.37}{T \times 133.15}} \times 10^{-5}$

where T is the temperature in $\degree C$.
